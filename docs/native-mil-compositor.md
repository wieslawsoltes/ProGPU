# Native MIL compositor

## Goal

ProGPU will provide a reflection-free C++ composition endpoint that can consume
LibreWPF's canonical DUCE/MIL command batches, retain the WPF resource graph,
lower it to the existing ProGPU semantic scene ABI, and execute that scene on
the same C++ renderer through either wgpu-native or provider-resolved Dawn.
The existing managed `ProGPU.Scene` compositor remains available as an
independent compatibility lane while parity is established.

This is a clean source-integrated replacement, not a binary shim that scrapes
managed WPF objects. Protocol structs are derived from the MIT-licensed WPF MCG
model and are consumed as typed byte records with explicit bounds checks.

## Protocol findings

WPF's client channel writes each command as:

```text
uint32 item_size_including_header
uint32 MILCMD
byte[] packed_command_fields_and_optional_payload
byte[0..3] dword_alignment_padding
```

`item_size` is at least eight, is divisible by four, and must fit entirely in
the submitted batch. The command packet returned by WPF's reader begins at the
`MILCMD` field and has `item_size - 4` bytes. Resource handles are 32-bit and
belong to a channel-local namespace. The current retail protocol contains 141
commands:

| Range | Area | Count |
| --- | --- | ---: |
| `0x01`–`0x3d` | transport, resources, visuals, targets, glyphs | 61 |
| `0x3e`–`0x56` | nested render-data instruction stream | 25 |
| `0x57`–`0x8d` | retained media, 3D, effect, geometry, brush, drawing resources | 55 |

The transport and render-data streams use the same item framing. The outer
`MilCmdRenderData` packet carries the nested stream byte count and then the
nested command bytes. Commands and structures are packed, so the decoder uses
bounded byte copies and never casts an untrusted address to a command struct.

## Architecture

```text
LibreWPF source-built PresentationCore
  DUCE command producer / typed portable producer
             |
             | canonical MIL batch bytes
             v
ProGPU.Native.MIL (C++20)
  framing validator -> channel handle table -> retained resource graph
      -> render-data decoder -> semantic scene lowering -> damage tracking
             |
             | ProGPU semantic scene stream ABI
             v
ProGPU.Native C++ compositor
  wgpu-native adapter       provider-resolved Dawn adapter
                                      |
                           Windows Dawn D3D12 / DXGI path
```

The native MIL layer is backend-neutral. It produces the same semantic scene
stream used by current C++ samples and the managed `ProGPU.Scene.Native`
compiler. Backend selection, device loss, external-image binding, submission
lifetime, hit testing, and render-target ownership remain in the native
compositor.

## Delivery stages and gates

### Stage 0 — protocol foundation (implemented)

- Complete command-ID namespace (`0x01`–`0x8d`).
- Zero-copy, bounds-checked batch reader.
- Transactional channel state: a rejected batch cannot partially mutate the
  live graph.
- Size-versioned C ABI exported by both native renderer modules and a typed
  allocation-free .NET batch submission owner in `ProGPU.Backend.Native`.
- Initial typed resource, visual, generic-target, and opaque render-data state.
- Strict failure for unknown commands, unsupported commands, invalid handles,
  type mismatches, invalid graph operations, and malformed sizes.

### Stage 1 — complete retained 2D resources

The first Stage 1 vertical slice is implemented in the typed C++ API, the
size-versioned C ABI, and `NativeMilChannel.CompileScene(...)`. It
decodes the exact WPF `MILCMD_SOLIDCOLORBRUSH`, nested
`MILCMD_DRAW_RECTANGLE`, and nested `MILCMD_DRAW_ELLIPSE` records, applies
retained visual offsets and opacity, supports balanced nested
`MILCMD_PUSH_OPACITY`/`MILCMD_POP` scopes, walks the target's visual tree with
cycle/depth validation, and emits the shared pointer-free ProGPU semantic scene
stream. Uniform-radius `MILCMD_DRAW_ROUNDED_RECTANGLE` is also lowered exactly;
non-uniform X/Y radii fail closed until the native analytic primitive carries
both axes. Ellipse centers/radii are converted exactly to native analytic
bounds, and every primitive kind is reported separately in typed scene metrics.
Scope opacity is composed with retained visual opacity in native semantic
state; malformed opacity and over/underflowed scope stacks fail closed.
Typed `MILCMD_MATRIXTRANSFORM`, `MILCMD_VISUAL_SETTRANSFORM`, and nested
`MILCMD_PUSH_TRANSFORM` are also implemented. Matrix values remain doubles in
the retained channel, are range-checked before lowering to the semantic ABI,
and compose in WPF row-vector order as local visual transform, visual offset,
parent transform, and then nested drawing scopes. Draw culling bounds are the
axis-aligned bounds of all four transformed primitive corners. Animation
handles, missing/wrong-type nonzero transforms, nonzero packet padding, and
unbalanced scopes fail closed transactionally; transform handle zero retains
WPF's defined balanced no-op scope. Animated brushes and pens and other nested
commands deliberately fail closed until their typed resources are implemented.
The slice is covered by byte-level fixtures that check semantic
brush, transform/opacity state, rectangle, ellipse and rounded-rectangle
primitives, transformed bounds, nested scope, rollback, scene identity,
generation, and tree metrics. The C ABI supports an explicit required-size
query, preserves the original 32-byte metrics caller contract when appending
new metrics, and writes into caller-owned storage; the managed owner returns
the completed semantic stream with typed compilation metrics for direct native
compositor submission.

The current Stage 1 slice implements the exact 52-byte `MILCMD_PEN` resource,
variable-size `MILCMD_DASHSTYLE` resource, and 44-byte nested
`MILCMD_DRAW_LINE` packet for unanimated solid-brush pens. Flat,
square, round, and triangle start/end caps map directly to the reusable ProGPU
geometry-stroke flags; pen brushes share the semantic brush table, and line
width/cap-conservative local bounds are transformed through the same four-
corner affine path. Nonempty dash resources route through ProGPU's reusable
semantic connected-stroke engine, preserving thickness-relative intervals,
offset, dash cap, odd-pattern repetition, and backend-independent execution.
Null pen handles and zero-width/null-brush pens are no-op draws. Thickness and
dash-offset animation, invalid dash values/enums, unresolved handles, nonzero
padding, and non-flat degenerate line caps fail closed transactionally. The
size-stable MIL scene metrics ABI now publishes `line_count` in its former
reserved tail field.

Axis-aligned `MILCMD_DRAW_RECTANGLE` records now accept independent fill and
pen handles. Rectangle pens lower to closed four-point semantic polylines, so
solid and dashed outlines share ProGPU's native join, miter-limit, dash-cap,
offset, odd-pattern, transform, and backend execution rules. Fill-only,
stroke-only, and fill-plus-stroke records remain distinct draws with one shared
brush table; stroke culling expands the local rectangle by half the pen width
before the four-corner affine bounds transform. Zero-width or zero-height
rectangle strokes still fail closed pending exact WPF collapse semantics.

`MILCMD_DRAW_ELLIPSE` records likewise accept independent fill and pen handles.
Solid ellipse pens lower to ProGPU's exact analytic full-ellipse arc primitive,
including non-uniform radii and affine semantic-state execution. Fill-only,
stroke-only, and fill-plus-stroke records share the native brush table; stroke
culling expands the local ellipse bounds by half the pen width before the
four-corner affine bounds transform. A nonempty dash pattern on an ellipse
fails closed until the native curve path can preserve phase continuously around
the full circumference. Degenerate ellipse strokes remain unsupported in this
checkpoint rather than being approximated.

Uniform-radius `MILCMD_DRAW_ROUNDED_RECTANGLE` records now accept independent
fill and pen handles. Positive-radius solid outlines lower to ProGPU's exact
rounded-rectangle analytic primitive with native stroke thickness, including
affine semantic-state execution and bounds expanded by half the pen width.
Fill-only, stroke-only, and fill-plus-stroke records share the native brush
table. A zero radius keeps the closed-polyline rectangle path so WPF join and
dash metadata are preserved. Nonempty dash patterns on curved corners,
non-uniform radii, and degenerate rounded-rectangle strokes fail closed until
their exact curve semantics are available.

The retained fixed-geometry slice implements the exact fixed-size
`MILCMD_LINEGEOMETRY`, `MILCMD_RECTANGLEGEOMETRY`, and
`MILCMD_ELLIPSEGEOMETRY` updates plus nested `MILCMD_DRAW_GEOMETRY`. Each
resource retains its primitive state and optional typed matrix-transform
handle. Line fills remain empty while solid and dashed pens reuse the same
stroke path as `MILCMD_DRAW_LINE`. Rectangle and ellipse resources reuse the
native analytic fill/stroke lowering used by their immediate draw commands,
including uniform rounded rectangles and geometry-local affine transforms.
Animated fields, non-uniform rounded-rectangle radii, uninitialized or
wrong-type resources fail closed transactionally.

The first retained general-path slice implements canonical variable-size
`MILCMD_PATHGEOMETRY` updates and nested fill-only `MILCMD_DRAW_GEOMETRY`.
The native channel validates WPF's `MIL_PATHGEOMETRY`, `MIL_PATHFIGURE`, fixed
line/quadratic/cubic/arc segments, and poly-line/poly-quadratic/poly-cubic
record links and sizes before committing retained state. Filled contours lower to one
backend-independent ProGPU semantic path batch with EvenOdd/Nonzero fill,
geometry-local affine transforms, exact validated cached local bounds when
present, conservative native bounds when WPF leaves `BoundsValid` clear, and
WPF's implicit fill closure for open figures. Malformed back-links, sizes, padding,
flags, counts, bounds, transforms, and handles roll back transactionally.
Endpoint arcs reuse the neutral native arc resolver shared with SVG glyph
paths, retain center/radii/sweep data in ProGPU's semantic arc record, and
preserve the degenerate-to-line rule. Fill compilation remains independent of
the separately retained stroke topology described below.

The first retained path-pen slice now keeps WPF stroke topology separately
from fill topology while decoding the same canonical figure stream. Line and
poly-line segments lower to ProGPU semantic polylines with the retained pen's
thickness, miter limit, start/end/dash caps, join, thickness-relative dash
intervals/offset, brush, and geometry-local affine transform. `SegIsAGap`
splits open figures into independent runs, using the pen's dash cap at each
gap boundary and preserving the figure start/end caps only at true open-figure
endpoints. Each run restarts the dash sequence as WPF's `CDasher::StartFigure`
does after a geometry gap. For closed figures the
decoder rotates after a gap and joins the stroked tail, implicit closing edge,
and stroked head into one open run, avoiding a false cap at the original figure
start while retaining dash caps at the actual gap. Fully stroked closed figures
remain one closed contour, and open figures
are never implicitly closed for stroking even though WPF fill closure remains
unchanged. A nonempty dash pattern on a closed gapped figure whose continuous
run crosses the original figure start fails closed: WPF resets dash phase at
that start yet joins the two widened pieces, which cannot be represented by
one current semantic polyline without changing phase or join shape. Stroked
quadratic/cubic/arc segments, `SegSmoothJoin`, and
non-flat-cap zero-length runs fail closed until reusable native curved and
per-join stroke primitives can preserve those semantics exactly. Unstroked
curves remain valid topology gaps and do not prevent neighboring line runs
from using the native path-pen lane.

The first retained `MILCMD_GEOMETRYGROUP` slice validates the canonical
variable child-handle payload, group fill rule, optional matrix transform,
typed geometry dependencies, and cycles transactionally. At execution, groups
whose children are identity-local retained `PathGeometry` resources aggregate
their contours into one semantic path batch, so the group's EvenOdd/Nonzero
rule is applied across child overlap exactly as WPF's `CShape` aggregation
does. Affine-transformed line/quadratic/cubic path children are baked into that
shared coordinate space exactly, including WPF's implicit closing fill edge;
their cached local bounds are conservatively transformed once. Fixed rectangle
and ellipse children join that same batch, including
geometry-local affine transforms and non-uniform rounded rectangles. Rectangle,
rounded-corner, and ellipse contours use WPF's `CFigureData` point order,
radius clamping, and `ARC_AS_BEZIER` cubic constant before applying the child
matrix; line children correctly contribute no fill. The group transform remains
one native path transform. Nested groups recurse through the same bounded
lowerer, compose each group/leaf transform in WPF order, and intentionally
ignore nested fill rules before applying the outer root fill rule. This matches
`CMilGeometryGroupDuce::GetShapeDataCore`, which copies every child figure with
`CShape::AddShapeData` and calls `SetFillMode` only on the resulting outer
shape. Nonsingular affine transforms on native arc records are baked without
flattening: ProGPU transforms the arc's two ellipse basis vectors, factors the
resulting `T*T^T` metric into orthogonal output axes/radii, projects the start
parameter into that basis, and reverses the sweep exactly when the affine
determinant is negative. Combined-geometry children, singular arc transforms,
and meaningful group pens currently fail closed until their contours or
strokes can be composed without approximation.

Canonical fixed-size `MILCMD_COMBINEDGEOMETRY` state now retains the optional
matrix transform, two geometry dependencies, and WPF Union/Intersect/Xor/
Exclude operation. Null operands become explicit empty leaves. Identity-local
`PathGeometry` operands lower to ProGPU's native postfix boolean program,
preserving each operand's own fill rule and executing the result in the native
path atlas on every backend. The same shared shallow
fill lowerer now accepts fixed rectangle and ellipse operands, including
geometry-local affine transforms and non-uniform rounded rectangles with WPF's
radius clamping, point order, and cubic constant; line operands become explicit
empty leaves. It also accepts affine-transformed line/quadratic/cubic path
operands using the same exact point/bounds baking as groups while preserving the
operand's own fill rule. A recursively flattened `GeometryGroup` is also a
boolean leaf: its root fill rule is retained while its group/child transforms
are baked into the leaf contours. Combined operands now recurse into that same
bounded geometry DAG and append their two subtrees plus operation in postfix
order. Nested combined transforms compose into descendant leaf transforms;
segment/node appends roll back together on failure, and conservative bounds
cover all nonempty descendants. Group/combined references share one cycle-
checked geometry DAG; deletion and malformed operation updates fail
transactionally. The same exact nonsingular affine arc factorization is shared
by group leaves and arbitrary-depth boolean leaves, including reflected/sheared
arcs and sweep reversal. Singular arc transforms and stroked operands remain
fail closed. Combined children inside a `GeometryGroup` also remain fail closed
because treating a boolean result as raw outer-fill contours would change WPF
semantics.

`NativeMilBatchBuilder` and `NativeMilRenderDataBuilder` provide the matching
managed producer for this supported subset. They write the canonical WPF
framing and packed field offsets directly into reusable buffer writers, expose
only typed resource/color/primitive inputs, and are shared by package smoke
tests so LibreWPF does not need private-structure probes or hand-coded arrays.

- Generate packed protocol declarations and size metadata from a checked-in
  neutral manifest produced from WPF MCG inputs.
- Implement scalar animation resources, remaining transform kinds,
  singular arc-transform fill semantics, curved path
  strokes/dashes and per-segment smooth joins,
  remaining pen draws,
  brushes, drawings, images, glyph runs, caches, guidelines, effects, and
  complete render-data decoding.
- Lower every supported update to stable semantic resource identities and
  generation numbers; unchanged resources must not be rebuilt.
- Add fixture capture/replay comparison against WPF's `CMilDataStreamReader`
  behavior and the existing managed LibreWPF renderer.

### Stage 2 — targets, scheduling, and parity services

- Add connection/partition/channel objects, handle duplication, out-of-band
  target updates, sync-flush replies, tier/capability replies, present/vblank
  scheduling, dirty regions, and device-loss recovery.
- Implement HWND and generic targets without leaking host-specific ownership
  into the retained scene layer.
- Add native hit-test result mapping and compositor diagnostics.

### Stage 3 — effects, 3D, media, and interop

- Complete shader effects, opacity masks, bitmap caches, 3D cameras/models,
  D3DImage/external texture binding, media frames, and color/text parity.
- Keep unsupported shader bytecode and external-handle forms fail-closed until
  a typed conversion or native backend implementation exists.

### Stage 4 — DirectX and DXGI facade parity

- Move the existing managed `ProGPU.DirectX` device/resource/view/pipeline
  compatibility model onto a native handle ABI shared with the MIL endpoint.
- Implement the measured D3D11/D3D12/DXGI/D3DCompiler export surface required
  by real package consumers. Do not attempt an unbounded system-DLL clone.
- On Windows, use Dawn's D3D12 backend for the compositor and explicit shared
  texture/fence paths for D3D11/D3D12 interop. Validate adapter LUID, format,
  alpha mode, row pitch, synchronization, resize, occlusion, and device loss.
- Preserve WebGPU behavior and semantic output across wgpu-native and Dawn;
  backend-specific differences require golden-image and metrics evidence.

### Stage 5 — LibreWPF selection and release gate

- Add an explicit runtime selector: managed portable, native MIL WebGPU, or
  native MIL Dawn/DirectX. The managed portable lane stays buildable and
  testable throughout migration.
- Package native runtimes for Windows x64/arm64 and the existing supported
  non-Windows RIDs. Verify exact ABI and protocol versions at startup.
- Run package-mode Toolkit/AvalonDock, Xceed when licensed, SciChart, input,
  clipping, hit testing, multi-window, DPI, and shutdown tests.

## Windows validation matrix

The primary integration guest is the discovered Parallels Windows 11 ARM64 VM.
The lane records guest OS build, .NET SDK, CMake/MSVC/Clang versions, adapter and
driver identity, Dawn backend, feature/limit set, and whether rendering uses
hardware, WARP, or another fallback. Required comparisons are:

1. Microsoft WPF MIL output on Windows versus LibreWPF managed portable output.
2. LibreWPF managed portable versus native MIL semantic streams.
3. Native wgpu/Dawn output versus Dawn D3D12 output.
4. DirectX compatibility API behavior versus native DirectX where the API is
   intentionally supported.

Tests use deterministic scenes, pixel tolerances, semantic stream hashes,
resource-generation/damage metrics, GPU validation output, and process lifetime
checks. A screenshot alone is not a parity result.

### Windows ARM64 qualification evidence — 2026-08-24

The current branch was qualified in the Parallels Windows 11 ARM64 guest with
OS build `26200.9168`, .NET SDK `10.0.400` / runtime `10.0.11`, Visual Studio
Build Tools `17.14.39`, ARM64 MSVC `19.44`, CMake `3.31.6`, and Ninja `1.12.1`.
The live adapter was `Parallels Display Adapter (WDDM)`, driver
`20.18.2641.57516`, using the D3D12 backend. The complete bounded gate was:

```powershell
.\eng\build-progpu-native-windows.ps1 `
  -Rid win-arm64 `
  -Compiler MSVC `
  -Generator Ninja `
  -BenchmarkProfile Smoke
```

Results:

- Both provider-resolved Dawn and wgpu-native renderer modules built with the
  ARM64 MSVC toolchain; all 11 native tests passed, including the MIL channel
  and Dawn ABI contracts.
- The live C++ sample rendered nine retained commands in five draw calls,
  uploaded 11,616 vertex bytes, completed a D3D12 readback, and emitted its PPM
  plus backend evidence file.
- The managed native-host sample lowered 16 source commands to 13 native
  commands and six draws, uploaded 27,464 vertex bytes plus 55,552 coverage
  bytes, and passed pre-render, post-render general-buffer, and readback-heap
  allocation probes before completing its readback.
- Two- and sixteen-positioned-glyph retained scenes passed exact native versus
  managed pixel parity with zero differing pixels and zero steady-frame
  managed allocations. The Parallels D3D12 profile uses a typed CPU R8 coverage
  atlas fallback in both implementations; normal adapters keep the shared GPU
  compute rasterizer. The 16-glyph native submission measured `0.5108 ms`
  versus `1.2558 ms` for the managed submission in the one-frame diagnostic.
- The 384-command mixed-picture native-only stress completed eight synchronized
  frames at `0.2721 ms/frame`. A separate live differential scene stayed within
  the independent-AA budget (maximum channel delta 2/255, zero pixels over
  3/255, mean absolute delta `0.0000622`). Solid/group opacity, external and
  masked images, semantic mixed scenes, semantic mask/effect chains, retained
  vector clips, blur/drop-shadow, Overlay and ColorDodge blending, and managed
  versus C++ text shaping also passed their declared parity contracts.
- The staged package contains both native renderer variants for `win-arm64`.

The affine-transform checkpoint at ProGPU commit `360a6f7e` was requalified
with the same complete gate. ARM64 MSVC compiled the new matrix resource,
visual-transform, and nested transform-scope paths; all 11 CTests passed,
including transformed semantic-state/bounds fixtures, null no-op scopes, and
transactional failure cases. Live retained rendering/readback, package staging,
the managed-host allocation probes, effect/vector/text cases, and isolated
stress/differential processes all completed. In that follow-up run the native
384-command stress measured `0.1244 ms/frame`; the bounded differential again
had maximum channel delta 2/255 and zero pixels over 3/255. Timing is diagnostic
for this VM, while the pass/fail contracts and recorded adapter identity are
the qualification evidence.

The solid-pen/line checkpoint at ProGPU commit `dadb26a5` was then qualified
with that same complete command from a clean Windows checkout. Both native
modules linked for ARM64, all 11 CTests passed (including cap mapping,
cap-aware transformed bounds, line metrics, Dawn ABI, and transactional
animated/dashed-pen rejection), and the live C++ and managed D3D12 samples
again completed their readback and post-build allocation probes. The bounded
mixed-picture differential remained at maximum delta 2/255 with zero pixels
over 3/255; external/masked images, semantic scenes, mask/effect chains,
vector clips, text shaping, Overlay, and ColorDodge remained inside their
declared contracts. The run reached its normal completion marker and staged
both `progpu_native.dll` and `progpu_native_dawn.dll` in the `win-arm64`
package runtime. One eight-frame synchronized managed-picture native profile
measured `0.6335 ms/frame`; VM timings remain diagnostic rather than release
thresholds.

The retained-dash checkpoint at ProGPU commit `fca6c7a2` was qualified from a
clean Windows checkout with a focused integration gate over the renderer
already covered by the immediately preceding full matrix. ARM64 MSVC rebuilt
both native modules and the MIL executable; the Windows MIL and Dawn contract
tests passed 2/2. The project-reference package consumer then built with zero
warnings and ran live on D3D12, compiling its retained dashed line through both
wgpu-native and Dawn MIL channels before completing renderer readback (`draws=1`,
16,384 pixels). This gate specifically covers variable packet decoding,
thickness-relative intervals/offset, dash-cap semantic-stroke lowering,
transactional validation, both exported ABIs, and managed package production.

The rectangle-pen checkpoint at ProGPU commit `89f0a838` passed the same
focused Windows ARM64 integration lane. MSVC rebuilt both native modules and
the MIL test executable, the MIL/Dawn contracts passed 2/2, and the updated
project-reference package consumer built with zero warnings. Its live D3D12
run compiled a dashed line plus a dashed fill-and-stroke rectangle through both
native MIL exports before completing readback (`draws=1`, 16,384 pixels). The
Windows checkout was clean at the exact qualified commit.

The solid-ellipse checkpoint at ProGPU commit `f24d715f` passed that focused
lane from a clean Windows checkout. The MIL and Dawn contracts passed 2/2, and
the package consumer compiled a fill-plus-solid-stroke ellipse through both
native MIL exports before completing live D3D12 readback (`draws=1`, 16,384
pixels). The same gate isolated and corrected Windows instance creation:
managed `WgpuContext` now supplies wgpu-native's typed D3D12 instance extension
instead of a backend-unspecified descriptor. WebGPU-init-only, render-only, and
combined MIL/render processes all completed with exit code zero under the
Parallels SYSTEM integration session. The C++ retained renderer independently
selected the Parallels D3D12 adapter, rendered nine commands in five draws,
uploaded 11,616 vertex bytes, and completed readback.

The uniform rounded-rectangle pen checkpoint at exact ProGPU commit
`84cdcead` passed the same focused Windows ARM64 lane from a clean checkout.
ARM64 MSVC rebuilt both native modules and the MIL executable, and the MIL/Dawn
contracts passed 2/2. The project-reference package consumer built with zero
warnings, compiled a pen-only rounded rectangle through both native MIL
exports, and then completed managed D3D12 rendering/readback (`draws=1`,
16,384 pixels). The independent C++ retained renderer also selected the
Parallels D3D12 adapter and completed its nine-command, five-draw,
11,616-vertex-byte readback gate.

The retained line-geometry checkpoint at exact ProGPU commit `5c4757c0`
passed the focused Windows ARM64 lane from a clean checkout. ARM64 MSVC rebuilt
both native modules and the MIL executable, and the MIL/Dawn contracts passed
2/2. The zero-warning project-reference package consumer compiled a typed,
transformed `LineGeometry`/`DrawGeometry` pen through both native MIL exports
before completing live D3D12 rendering/readback (`draws=1`, 16,384 pixels).
The independent C++ retained renderer again completed its nine-command,
five-draw, 11,616-vertex-byte D3D12 readback gate.

The retained rectangle/ellipse-geometry checkpoint was qualified at exact
ProGPU commit `a1c0fd81` (feature implementation `bc6b5029`) from a clean
Windows checkout. ARM64 MSVC rebuilt `progpu_native.dll`,
`progpu_native_dawn.dll`, and the MIL executable; the MIL/Dawn contracts passed
2/2. The zero-warning project-reference package consumer compiled transformed
retained line, uniform rounded-rectangle, and ellipse geometry resources
through both native exports, then completed live Parallels D3D12
rendering/readback (`draws=1`, 16,384 pixels). The independent C++ retained
renderer again completed nine commands, five draws, 11,616 uploaded vertex
bytes, and readback. The gate required the consumer's app-local native DLL
hashes to match the freshly rebuilt modules after detecting and replacing an
older incremental-build artifact.

The retained general-path and endpoint-arc checkpoint was qualified at exact
native implementation commit `51550b6e` from a clean Windows checkout with
the complete ARM64 MSVC gate. Strict `/W4 /WX` first exposed an implicit
fill-rule enum conversion in the semantic path resource; the implementation
now keeps the C ABI field type explicit. Both native modules linked, all 11
CTest contracts passed, and the live C++ and managed samples completed D3D12
rendering/readback on the Parallels adapter. The managed sample lowered 16
source commands to 13 native commands and six draws, uploading 27,464 vertex
bytes plus 55,552 coverage bytes. The eight-frame native managed-picture
stress measured `0.1235 ms/frame`; the bounded differential had maximum delta
2/255, zero pixels above 3/255, and mean absolute delta `0.0000622`. Retained
path-atlas qualification rasterized 49 paths with 4,112 path-upload bytes and
727,552 coverage-staging bytes, remaining inside its independent-edge budget
(maximum delta 46/255, 1,048 pixels over tolerance, mean `0.0171`). Exact
Overlay and ColorDodge cases, image/mask/effect chains, vector/text contracts,
and final `win-arm64` package staging also passed.

Package-consumer commit `a11ad9fd` then exercised that exact staged native
implementation rather than a source-only fixture. Its app-local SHA-256 hashes
matched the newly staged `progpu_native.dll` and `progpu_native_dawn.dll`; the
consumer built with zero warnings, compiled a transformed retained path with a
quadratic segment and rotated WPF endpoint arc through both MIL exports,
installed the wgpu-native semantic stream, rendered it live on D3D12, and read
back 16,384 pixels. The installed scene reported 15 semantic resources and two
draw calls before the independent renderer smoke completed.

The geometry-group/combined-geometry checkpoint at exact ProGPU commit
`41af1e66` passed the complete Windows ARM64 MSVC gate from a clean checkout.
Both native modules rebuilt under strict warnings and all 11 fresh CTests
passed, including MIL geometry-DAG, boolean-program, null-operand, cycle,
deletion, and transactional rollback cases plus the Dawn ABI contract. The
independent C++ and managed samples completed live D3D12 rendering/readback;
the managed sample again produced 13 native commands, six draws, 27,464 vertex
bytes, and 55,552 coverage bytes with successful allocation probes. The
bounded differential remained at maximum delta 2/255 with zero pixels above
3/255 and mean `0.0000622`; vector, image, mask/effect, text, Overlay, and
ColorDodge contracts also passed, and the package runtime was restaged.

The updated zero-warning package consumer then verified exact SHA-256 matches
for both freshly staged DLLs, compiled two retained paths plus an EvenOdd
`GeometryGroup` and an Exclude `CombinedGeometry` through both MIL exports,
installed the wgpu-native semantic stream, and completed live D3D12 readback.
The installed graph reported 17 semantic resources and two draw calls before
the independent immediate renderer smoke completed its 16,384-pixel readback.

The retained line-path stroke checkpoint at exact ProGPU commit `70c88279`
passed the complete Windows ARM64 MSVC gate from a clean checkout. Both native
modules rebuilt under `/W4 /WX`; all 11 CTests passed, including closed/open
stroke topology, geometry-gap dash caps, affine/dash/pen propagation,
unsupported smooth/curved strokes, and closed-gap dash-seam fail-closed cases.
The independent C++ and managed hosts completed live Parallels D3D12
rendering/readback and allocation probes. The bounded differential remained at
maximum delta 2/255 with zero pixels above 3/255 and mean `0.0000622`; path
atlas, image/mask/effect, semantic-layer, text, Overlay, and ColorDodge
contracts all passed. The synchronized eight-frame native diagnostic measured
`0.0902 ms/frame` on this VM.

The updated zero-warning package consumer then copied the exact staged
`progpu_native.dll` and `progpu_native_dawn.dll`; each app-local SHA-256 matched
its staged source. It compiled the existing path/group/combined graph plus a
transformed dashed closed `PathGeometry` whose first edge is a WPF geometry gap
through both MIL exports, installed the wgpu-native stream, and completed live
D3D12 readback. The installed graph reported 18 semantic resources and three
draw calls before the independent immediate renderer completed its
16,384-pixel readback.

The fixed-child `GeometryGroup` checkpoint at exact ProGPU commit `18ccb55c`
passed the complete Windows ARM64 MSVC gate. Both wgpu-native and
provider-resolved Dawn modules rebuilt under `/W4 /WX`; all 11 CTests passed,
including exact transformed rectangle, ellipse, non-uniform rounded-rectangle,
and empty line-child group contours. The independent C++ and managed hosts
completed live D3D12 rendering/readback and allocation probes. The bounded
mixed differential remained at maximum delta 2/255, zero pixels above 3/255,
and mean `0.0000622`; external and masked images, semantic mask/effect layers,
path atlas, blur/drop-shadow, text, Overlay, and ColorDodge contracts also
passed before fresh `win-arm64` package staging.

The zero-warning project-reference package consumer copied both staged DLLs
app-locally and verified identical source/destination SHA-256 values:
`73fcc3871408d4642d6ace3817b30c36194e9938c36dd60f8e4d09325ec4495f`
for `progpu_native.dll` and
`709e59f97f484dc74dd5693f207dbbe96ba568d1f692b93c6df186e5d535c8c8`
for `progpu_native_dawn.dll`. Both MIL exports compiled the group containing
transformed rounded-rectangle and ellipse children. The installed wgpu-native
stream then completed live D3D12 readback with 18 semantic resources, three
draws, and 16,384 pixels before the independent immediate renderer smoke.

The shared fixed-operand `CombinedGeometry` checkpoint at exact ProGPU commit
`7d0fad61` passed the complete Windows ARM64 MSVC gate. The refactored shallow
fill lowerer compiled into both native modules under `/W4 /WX`; all 11 CTests
passed, including transformed fixed boolean leaves, non-uniform rounded
rectangles, preserved identity-local path operands, and the Dawn contract. Live
C++ and managed D3D12 rendering/readback, allocation probes, and the complete
bounded differential matrix passed. The mixed differential remained at maximum
delta 2/255, zero pixels above 3/255, and mean `0.0000622`; path-atlas,
image/mask/effect, text, Overlay, and ColorDodge results stayed within their
established contracts. The synchronized eight-frame native diagnostic measured
`0.1618 ms/frame` on this VM before fresh package staging.

The zero-warning project-reference consumer then verified exact app-local
matches for the staged modules: SHA-256
`288438736839fc4e673fe4dbd7a714eda8158df181c694d0efd3d92dadf1e984`
for `progpu_native.dll` and
`31b0fe54964b8163b4a1d132359e89de58367b31550020d924c681f6cc4732b6`
for `progpu_native_dawn.dll`. Both MIL exports compiled transformed fixed
rounded-rectangle and ellipse boolean operands, and the installed wgpu-native
stream completed live D3D12 readback with 18 semantic resources, three draws,
and 16,384 pixels.

The affine path-leaf checkpoint at exact ProGPU commit `9634af73` passed the
complete Windows ARM64 MSVC gate. Both modules rebuilt under `/W4 /WX`, and all
11 CTests passed with exact transformed line, quadratic, cubic, implicit fill
closure, conservative bounds, legacy identity-path operands, and transformed-
arc fail-closed coverage. Live C++/managed D3D12 rendering and readback,
allocation probes, text, path atlas, image/mask/effect, Overlay, ColorDodge, and
the bounded differential matrix all passed. The mixed differential remained at
maximum delta 2/255, zero pixels above 3/255, and mean `0.0000622`; the
synchronized eight-frame native diagnostic measured `0.0925 ms/frame` before
fresh package staging.

The zero-warning project-reference consumer verified identical staged/app-local
SHA-256 values:
`6493681ddc832c58b5d549a22cae070839268a7f66d41aae70c0c9450ba59f3f`
for `progpu_native.dll` and
`28a82155eedaa4c1b3c73b982f3c5e8f4e475687eef300946be8d6f1158d4379`
for `progpu_native_dawn.dll`. Both MIL exports compiled a transformed
line/quadratic/cubic path leaf in the retained group, and the installed
wgpu-native stream completed live D3D12 readback with 18 semantic resources,
three draws, and 16,384 pixels.

The recursive `GeometryGroup` checkpoint at exact native implementation commit
`e0281b69` passed the complete Windows ARM64 MSVC gate. Both modules rebuilt
under `/W4 /WX`, all 11 CTests passed, and the MIL contract covered nested group
transform composition, outer-fill-rule ownership, groups as combined-geometry
boolean leaves, cycles, rollback, and transformed-arc fail-closed behavior. Live
C++/managed D3D12 rendering and readback, allocation probes, text, path atlas,
image/mask/effect, Overlay, ColorDodge, and the bounded differential matrix all
passed. The mixed differential remained at maximum delta 2/255, zero pixels
above 3/255, and mean `0.0000622`; the synchronized eight-frame native
diagnostic measured `0.1562 ms/frame` before fresh package staging.

Package-consumer checkpoint `14603fa2` then verified identical staged/app-local
SHA-256 values:
`e6e71dbca0b0e846de332c7bbade0362a9d19f2e4d16eef93aa73dce8640352e`
for `progpu_native.dll` and
`5a0bae5f610cfecf5a945b850a91251c725f97d7592903c78e9e2d24a5fcd79d`
for `progpu_native_dawn.dll`. Its 40-command, 17-resource seed compiled a
recursively transformed affine path group through both MIL exports. The
installed wgpu-native stream completed live Parallels D3D12 readback with 18
semantic resources, three draws, and 16,384 pixels; the separate immediate
renderer smoke also passed.

The recursive `CombinedGeometry` checkpoint at exact ProGPU commit `8bf9a0c5`
(native implementation `6326cdf2`) passed the complete Windows ARM64 MSVC
gate. Both modules rebuilt under `/W4 /WX`, all 11 CTests passed, and the MIL
fixture verified a five-node postfix boolean tree with exact segment offsets,
leaf fill rules, nested group/combined transform composition, operation order,
conservative bounds, and rollback. Live C++/managed D3D12 rendering/readback,
allocation probes, text, path atlas, image/mask/effect, Overlay, ColorDodge,
and the bounded differential matrix passed. The mixed differential remained at
maximum delta 2/255, zero pixels above 3/255, and mean `0.0000622`; the noisy
eight-frame VM diagnostic measured `0.6330 ms/frame` before package staging.

The zero-warning project-reference consumer verified exact staged/app-local
SHA-256 matches:
`6ac27898f1f067854ac3e79bf415ecd41f9f79c3208a0d45618e0cf47047520d`
for `progpu_native.dll` and
`d98b7f7dd3a0315c5420ca5ca63f85354e9daec5bb8ede4468e097fd191dd906`
for `progpu_native_dawn.dll`. Its 42-command, 18-resource channel seed compiled
a nested group/combined boolean tree through both MIL exports. The installed
wgpu-native stream completed live Parallels D3D12 readback with 18 semantic
resources, three draws, and 16,384 pixels; the immediate renderer smoke also
passed.

Two adapter-specific limitations remain explicit. Retained GPU hit-test
readback is deferred on the Parallels display adapter because its blocking
readback path stalls, although the retained D3D12 render/readback sample passes.
The legacy managed renderer also removes the Parallels D3D12 device on the
dense 384-command mixed-picture workload; the same workload passes through the
C++ renderer, so this adapter's gate keeps full native stress and a bounded
managed differential as separate processes. Neither limitation is evidence of
full DirectX/MIL parity; Stages 1–5 remain open until their listed protocol and
integration surfaces are implemented.

## Invariants

- No reflection or private managed field scanning in the product bridge.
- No pointer-shaped WPF objects in public package contracts.
- All protocol reads are bounds checked; unknown required data fails closed.
- Channel batches are transactional at the ProGPU boundary.
- Resource identity and generation are stable across unchanged frames.
- Native renderer APIs remain reusable by WPF, WinUI, and Avalonia.
- DirectX is a backend/interop surface over the shared renderer, not a second
  scene implementation.
