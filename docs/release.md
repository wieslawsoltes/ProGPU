# ProGPU Release Workflow

ProGPU packages are built from the explicit package list in `eng/progpu-package-list.sh`.
The release workflow does not pack samples, tests, diagnostic tools, or framework shim projects.
It also builds the separately versioned Avalonia 11 and 12 integration packages
from `scripts/progpu-package-list.sh`.

Preview.48 delivers exact transformed-stroke semantics on top of the
successfully published preview.47 boundary. Source-space thickness provenance
now survives Scene, Avalonia, WPF, System.Drawing, Skia, retained pictures,
append/replay, static buffers, GPU transforms, archives, and GPU hit testing.
Conformal scale is applied exactly once; anisotropic and sheared strokes lower
through transformed local outlines; and fixed-device, non-scaling, dashed,
cap, join, shader-hairline, and DXF cosmetic strokes retain their intended
device-space behavior. Indexed polyline and spline recording remains
allocation-free, with bounded direct compilation and transform-adaptive spline
sampling. Rendering stays on the typed retained WebGPU path without a CPU
renderer or reflection bridge. The clean-room architecture, mathematical
contract, complexity, and cross-engine research are recorded in
`docs/STROKE_TRANSFORM_RESEARCH.md`.

WinUI remains at 4,952 exact of 16,579 official declarations with 11,627
remaining, and the XAML compiler remains pre-MVP. These are continuation
ledgers rather than behavioral-completion claims. Detailed remaining work is
pinned in `docs/WINUI_API_PARITY.md`, `docs/SKIASHARP_API_PARITY.md`, and
`docs/xaml-compiler/ROADMAP.md`.

## Preview.48 closure and continuation

The release boundary includes the reusable, framework-neutral media engine,
native platform media/audio providers, WebGPU presentation and effects, the
standalone `ProGPU.Media.Editing` project, and the media-player/editor samples.
The WinUI-shaped media surface remains reusable by Avalonia, LibreWPF, and
LibreWinForms without making the editor API part of the official WinUI parity
claim.

The next WinUI parity branch starts from the immutable preview.48 tag. It must
retain the official NuGet metadata comparator and proceed through API-contract
markers, retained WebGPU Composition families, behavior-complete XAML control
and property-system clusters, removal of accidental ProGPU-only declarations,
and matched rendering/performance validation. The exact baseline remains 4,952
of 16,579 declarations; behavior, accessibility, device-loss, and rendering
quality remain independently gated.

The XAML compiler remains pre-MVP. Preview.48 retains automatic projection of
changed stable XAML identities to detached Roslyn metadata diagnostic origins.
The five remaining product blockers are runtime capability adapters; atomic
metadata apply, XAML publication, joint commit, and recovery;
namescope/resource/template fine patching with safe fallback; cross-platform
stress, performance, visual, accessibility, and collectible-context gates; and
published-feed host and productization evidence.

SkiaSharp's official metadata ledger remains closed at 4,222/4,222 with zero
missing. The stroke compiler keeps common indexed polyline and spline recording
free of geometry-graph allocation; direct bounded polyline compilation is
`O(N)`, while spline tessellation adapts to the current device transform rather
than forcing 100 segments for every replay. Fixed-device and framebuffer
hairlines are expanded after the full affine centerline transform, while normal
strokes preserve exact source-local outline semantics. This release makes no
universal performance-superiority claim; performance and pixel correctness
remain one contract.

The exact PR #87 head passed all 16 checks across Ubuntu, macOS, and Windows
build/test lanes, portable and mobile packaging, source-built Avalonia, native
Dawn, native/ProGPU SVG image parity and CPU benchmarks, official SkiaSharp and
WinUI metadata, and release documentation. Local final gates pass 3,569 core
tests, 240 headless tests, and 185 focused stroke/hairline/hit-test cases. A
fresh exact-head macOS Release host exercised retained-static, GPU-camera,
dynamic GPU-transform, and dynamic CPU-recorded DXF paths through zoom and pan;
the measured cosmetic segment changed length by about 7.7 times while retaining
the same two dominant device-pixel rows. Ordinary vector-shape scaling was also
manually checked, with exact normal-stroke scaling covered by the automated
transform suite.

## Avalonia Integration Packages

- `ProGPU.Avalonia.Rendering` `12.0.5-preview.48`
- `ProGPU.Avalonia.SilkNet` `12.0.5-preview.48`
- `ProGPU.Avalonia.Rendering` `11.3.18-preview.48`
- `ProGPU.Avalonia.SilkNet` `11.3.18-preview.48`

These packages are packed on the portable runner and published after the
`0.1.0-preview.48` runtime package set so their exact ProGPU dependencies are
available first.

## Local Package Build

```bash
PROGPU_PACKAGE_VERSION=0.1.0-preview.48 ./eng/progpu-pack.sh
PROGPU_PACKAGE_OUTPUT=artifacts/packages-avalonia/Release ./scripts/progpu-pack.sh
```

The script writes packages and symbol packages to `artifacts/packages/Release` by default.
Set `PROGPU_PACKAGE_OUTPUT` to use a different folder.
The default `all` group requires macOS with the Android and iOS workloads. Linux
can validate the portable set with `PROGPU_PACKAGE_GROUP=portable`; use
`PROGPU_PACKAGE_GROUP=mobile` on macOS for the two mobile host packages. The
release workflow combines and re-verifies both outputs before publishing.

## Local Package Publishing

`eng/progpu-publish.sh` packs the explicit shipping package set and pushes each package with `--skip-duplicate`; `dotnet nuget push` discovers and uploads the matching symbol package automatically. It requires the API key in the environment and never writes the key to the repository:

```bash
read -rsp "NuGet API key: " NUGET_API_KEY
export NUGET_API_KEY
PROGPU_PACKAGE_VERSION=0.1.0-preview.48 ./eng/progpu-publish.sh
./scripts/progpu-publish.sh
unset NUGET_API_KEY
```

The runtime publisher completes before the Avalonia integration publisher so
the latter's exact ProGPU dependencies are available first. Both targets
default to NuGet.org. Set `NUGET_SOURCE` to publish to another v3-compatible
feed.

## GitHub Actions

- `Build` restores, builds, and runs the main ProGPU test project on Linux, macOS, and Windows, packs portable packages on Linux, and packs mobile packages on macOS.
- `Docs` verifies that README/package documentation stays in sync with the release package list.
- `Browser Pages` publishes the shared browser gallery with WebAssembly AOT and deploys it to GitHub Pages after changes reach `main`.
- `Release` validates and packs portable packages and the Avalonia integration lanes on Linux, packs mobile packages on macOS, verifies the combined runtime dependency closure, publishes runtime packages followed by Avalonia packages, and creates a tag-driven GitHub Release.

Manual releases use `workflow_dispatch` with a package version. Tag releases use tags named `v*`,
for example `v0.1.0-preview.48`.

## NuGet Publishing

Publishing to NuGet.org is intentionally gated:

- Manual workflow runs push only when the `publish` input is true.
- Tag runs that match `v*` push after validation.
- The workflow requires the repository secret `NUGET_API_KEY`.

The publish step uses `dotnet nuget push --skip-duplicate` against `https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json`.
Tag runs create the matching GitHub Release with `gh release create --generate-notes` and attach the built `.nupkg` and `.snupkg` assets.
